# HR_Data:-
This is a supervised machine learning data science project.

# The notebook includes a full data science project including the following:

* Data Preparation
* Importing and checking dataset
* Data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Wrangling
* Machine Learning
* Train-test split
* Random forest model
* Balanced random forest model
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Model Application
* Feature importance evaluation
# The Jupyter Notebook is divided into several sections:

# Data Preparation
  * This section includes importing, exploring, and preparing the data. Several tables of data and descriptive visuals are viewable in this section. There are no interactive elements in this section.
# Machine Learning
  * This section covers creating and testing the predictive models. Graphical representations of accuracy measures are viewable in this section. There are no interactive elements in this section.
# Application
  * A table of feature importance and the interactive application comprise this section.
  * The interactive application is comprised of multiple widgets. To use the application to make a prediction:
  * Enter values for each attribute of the employee using the sliders and dropdown boxes.
  * Click the ‘Predict!’ button.
  * Enter new values for the attributes and click the button again for a new prediction.

# HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI
The HR Analytics Dashboard using PowerBI project primarily focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization. The objective is to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to employee turnover. By leveraging HR data and utilizing Power BI, the project aims to provide valuable insights to HR professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to reduce attrition rates.

# Titanic
The Titanic survivor prediction is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and others. The dataset used for this task usually includes information about passengers on the Titanic, including those who survived and those who did not.
